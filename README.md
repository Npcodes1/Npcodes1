### Hi there, everyone.ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Nicole and I'm currently teaching myself coding. I come from a science background and hoping to one day incorporate the two worlds together.ðŸ˜Š

Some things about me: 
- Iâ€™m currently working on freeCodeCamp.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Applied Visual Design in CSS.
- Iâ€™m looking for help with...everything lol.
- Pronouns: She/Her
- Fun fact: I take kickboxing as a way to de-stress.
