## Hi there, everyone!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicole and I'm a coding newbie. I come from a science/healthcare background with over 7 years of experience in molecular and microbiology testing. I currently work in a lab as a Medical Technologist. As a hospital worker, I've learned to deal and thrive in highly stressful situations, be able to adapt, and troubleshoot quickly and efficiently, which I know will be helpful in my journey in tech. ðŸ˜Š

## Some things about me: 
- I love puzzles and brainteasers.
- I take kickboxing and aerial arts as a way to de-stress.
- My pronouns are She/Her
- I'm a lover of foreign dramas

## What I've learned so far:
- HTML
- CSS

## What I'm working on:
 - JavaScript (in freeCodeCamp)
